You will now refactor the following Python function to eliminate the "Feature Envy" code smell while adhering to the system's guidelines. The logic and functionality must remain unchanged, but you should ensure that the function's responsibilities are handled in the appropriate class, reducing its dependency on external classes or their data. Document your changes as specified in the system prompt.

Here is the Python code that requires refactoring:

```python
{code_snippet}
```
Refactor this function by moving or delegating functionality to the correct class if it is overly reliant on that classâ€™s data or methods. Each class modification should be provided in a separate code block, commented with the respective class name. Remember to preserve the same function name, inputs, and outputs. """.strip()
