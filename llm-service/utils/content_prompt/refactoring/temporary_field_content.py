You will now refactor the following Python code to eliminate the "Temporary Fields" code smell while adhering to the system's guidelines. The logic and functionality must remain unchanged, but you should ensure the refactored code is modular, Pythonic, and free of unnecessary or rarely used fields. If no temporary fields are found, return the code unmodified.

Here is the Python code snippet that requires refactoring:

```python
{code_snippet}
```
Refactor this code by removing or relocating any attributes or variables that are only occasionally used or remain uninitialized for most of the codeâ€™s lifecycle. If a variable is only used within a single function, consider converting it to a local variable. Ensure your output is contained within one code block, remains clean and readable, and includes comments explaining your refactoring choices.
